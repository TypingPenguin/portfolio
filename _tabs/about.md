Hi, I'm **Floris Kromwijk**, a 28-year-old double-degree Master's student in **Computer Science** and **Industrial Design Engineering** at the University of Twente.

Over the past few years, I have had the privilege of studying at three different universities. This experience has not only broadened my academic horizons but also helped me discover my true passions. Through this journey, I've come to realize what subjects I find most interesting and how they align with my personal values.

One key insight I’ve gained is that I am deeply invested in understanding and managing all aspects of a project. I believe this holistic approach is essential for efficiently delivering reliable, high-quality products—no matter the technology involved. To achieve this, I’ve pursued two complementary Master's degrees: a hardware/process-focused Master in **Industrial Design Engineering** and a software-focused Master in **Computer Science**. This combination empowers me to create products with the least amount of limitations, enabling me to tackle challenges from multiple angles.

What truly excites me is engineering solutions that integrate seamlessly into the user’s life, enhancing their experience and improving their everyday activities. I am passionate about developing technology that serves real-world needs in a way that is both functional and intuitive.
