# Vintage Case Bluetooth Speaker

## Project Overview  
This was a **one-day project** using a pair of gutted speakers from **1974**.  
To repurpose them, I integrated **Bluetooth functionality** and housed the system inside a **retro carrying case**—chosen not just for its aesthetic, but also for practical reasons: the original speakers were **very heavy**, and the handle makes it easy to bring to parties or gatherings.

## Caution  
**Warning to headphone users**: Please lower your volume before playing the demo video below—the speaker packs quite a punch.
