# Bachelor Thesis – Virus-Killing Mask Concepts  

## Project Overview  
After the outbreak of COVID-19, I wanted to design a product that could be helpful in future epidemics. In collaboration with **Benchmark**, this project focused on developing a mask that actively **kills virus particles**, instead of merely filtering them passively.

We explored various technological approaches, with **two main directions** emerging:

- **UV-based disinfection**
- **Electrically-based virus deactivation**

Through extensive **calculations, expert consultations**, and **concept development**, we created several promising ideas. Below are renders from the explored concepts. For more details, feel free to contact me!



## UV Disinfection Concept  

Using **UV light** to neutralize virus particles is a proven technique, especially in controlled environments. The challenge lies in calculating the correct **UV intensity** relative to the **airflow speed** in a wearable format.

To better view the images, you might need to switch to light mode, my apologies.

## Electric Disinfection Concept  

Using **electricity** to kill viruses is a novel idea. Although **research is limited**, early results were promising. This method still requires more investigation to verify its effectiveness across various virus types.
