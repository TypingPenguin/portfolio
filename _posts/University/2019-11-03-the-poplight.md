# The PopLight  

## Goal  
For this project, we were tasked with designing a **Pop-Up installation** that would be placed in the city center of **Enschede** for a few months.

##### Renders
![3D model #1](1.png){: w="200" height="auto" .normal }
![3D model #2](2.png){: w="200" height="auto" .normal }

##### Posters
![Poster #1](3.jpg){: w="200" height="auto" .normal }
![Poster #2](4.jpg){: w="200" height="auto" .normal }
![Poster #3](5.jpg){: w="200" height="auto" .normal }



## Project  
As a group, we designed a **bench that projects animations onto the church** in the city center.  
The purpose was to provide **a sheltered waiting space** where people could socialize while enjoying the **visual experience**.


##### Scale models

## My Role  
I was mainly responsible for the **3D visualization** of the product.  
All renders were created using **Blender**.

## Time
