# SoundAround – Wearable for Sensory Support

## Project Overview  
For this project, we were tasked with designing a product that could support individuals with autism in their day-to-day lives.  

The final concept is **SoundAround**, a wearable **necklace** designed to enhance the user’s **awareness of their surroundings** using **gentle, directional vibrations**. The aim was to provide sensory feedback that improves safety and comfort in public spaces.
