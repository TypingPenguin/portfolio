# Clover 5 – Grow Fresh Herbs at Home


![Clover 5 Pods](Capture.PNG){: w="300" height="auto" .right }

## Goal  
For this project, we were tasked with developing a full **Product-Service System (PSS)**.  
We created **Clover 5**, a subscription model that allows users to grow fresh herbs at home with minimal effort.

Subscribers receive smart planting pots at the start of their subscription and regularly receive refill pots with new seeds tailored to their preferences and seasonality.
