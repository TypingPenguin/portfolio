# Pasta Machine Design for Modern Families

As part of a first-year Bachelor in Industrial Design Engineering project, I was tasked with designing a pasta machine individually. The challenge included identifying a target audience and tailoring the product accordingly.

I chose to focus on young modern families, where design aesthetics and safety are both crucial. The machine needed to blend seamlessly into a contemporary home environment, while also being safe and intuitive enough to use with children. This dual focus guided the design process from start to finish.

After exploring multiple concepts and iterating on various ideas, I arrived at a final design that meets these criteria. It balances modern aesthetics, functional safety, and usability, making it a practical addition to any modern kitchen.
