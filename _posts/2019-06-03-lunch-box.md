# Lunch Box Creation

## Goal  
During this project, we were tasked with prototyping a concept from the previous module. Our team chose to develop a lunchbox concept designed by a fellow classmate.  

The key idea behind this lunchbox was to **keep vegetables fresh** by storing them whole on one side of the box. Just before eating, users could slice them using an integrated **cutting mechanism**—a handle connected to internal blades—ensuring the **freshest salad possible**.

## Product Development  
Before building the prototype, we **created a detailed CAD model in SolidWorks**. This approach allowed us to divide tasks efficiently, enabling multiple team members to produce different components simultaneously.  

The final prototype was assembled successfully, and as shown below, it functioned as intended.

Here is a short video showing a demo of the prototype.

## My Role  
My primary responsibilities in this project were:  
- **CAD modeling**: Ensuring that all components fit together properly in the final design.  
- **Cost estimation**: Analyzing the feasibility of mass production and estimating manufacturing costs.
