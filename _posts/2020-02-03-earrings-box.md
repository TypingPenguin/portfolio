# Earrings & Custom LED Box  

## Project Overview  
For a special gift, I hand-crafted a pair of **sterling silver earrings**. To complement the earrings, I designed and 3D-printed a custom **hinged box** with an **integrated LED lighting mechanism**.  

The **hinge was printed in place**, allowing the box to function smoothly without additional assembly. Upon opening, the box automatically **activates two LEDs**, illuminating the earrings for a beautiful presentation.
