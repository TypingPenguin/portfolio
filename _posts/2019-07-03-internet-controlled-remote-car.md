# Construction of a remote controlled car

## Goal
We were tasked with creating a **smart toy car** for children to use while their parents shopped in the mall.  
Our goal was to design a car with **safety-focused smart features** to make it worry-free for parents while keeping it fun for kids.

    <em>Ergonomic controller Design</em>
  </figure>
</div>


## Our Solution  
Our **smart car** included:  
- **Collision detection and avoidance**  
- **Anti-fall sensors** to prevent falling off stairs  
- **Built-in music player** controlled by the child  
- **Remote control over the internet** for parents  
- **Automatic alerts** notifying parents if the child leaves the seat  

For our **prototype**, we used an **Xbox controller** connected to a computer running a **web interface** to simulate remote control.

## My role
I was responsible for:  
- **Software and hardware integration**  
- Ensuring all components worked together, **Integration Engineer**
- Implementing **MCU programming, sensor integration, and web-based control system**  

## Looking back
This was one of my most enjoyable university projects.  
I learned a lot by:  
- **Stripping a remote-controlled car** and adding custom sensors, an MCU, and speakers  
- **Hacking into the control system** for internet-based control  
- **Developing a webpage** to read input from an **Xbox controller**  

This project solidified my interest in **software-hardware product development**.
