# Wing Earrings – Sterling Silver  

## Project Overview  
For a special gift, I designed and created a pair of **wing-shaped earrings** from **Sterling Silver**.  

Since the design was **too intricate for manual production**, I opted to use **Shapeways**, a service that allows you to upload a **3D model** and have it produced in a variety of materials. These earrings were manufactured using **lost wax casting**, a method ideal for achieving fine details in metalwork.  

Despite their **small size** (approximately **11mm × 11mm**), the final pieces turned out beautifully, capturing every delicate curve and contour.
