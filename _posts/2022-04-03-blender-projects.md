# Blender Projects â€“ 3D Renders and Animations
## Project Overview

I have a deep passion for creating visually striking content, and a large part of this interest lies in using Blender. These images and videos are the result of my exploration of new Blender techniques, which I learned through a variety of tutorials. Each render was created for Inktober, where I challenged myself to complete them within a few hours.
