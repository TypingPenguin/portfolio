# Handcrafted Dice Vault  

## Project Overview  
This **Dice Vault** was custom-made for someone who wanted a dedicated place to store their premium **dice sets**.  

The vault is crafted from **Zebrawood**, a visually striking hardwood known for its bold grain patterns. To create a **smooth and satisfying closing mechanism**, I embedded **neodymium magnets** into the design.  

This project posed a challenge as I didnâ€™t have all the ideal tools for the job, but careful planning and craftsmanship helped bring the design to life.
